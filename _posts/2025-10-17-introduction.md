I've always loved how games made me feel. As a medium, games have the unrivalled ability to *render* worlds and bring them to life. I have a distinct memory of my first time playing *Infamous: Second Son* - being completely lost in the rain-soaked streets of virtual Seattle. The street lights reflected off of puddles, wet brick walls glistening  under the drizzle - the first rainfall scene in the game made me feel like I was experiencing something magical. I had never seen the spirit of something mundane be captured in such divine detail. Despite the neon beams, fiery explosions, and super-human abilities, the world just felt so *real*.

This moment made me curious: what is it about this medium that makes it feel so real? Technically when I boot up a game all I see are pixels, and beneath that streams of 0s and 1s. Yet through rendering, lighting, music, sound effects, level design, interactive systems, feedback, etc. these abstractions gain texture emotion and presence.

## What is this about?

This portfolio is where I want to explore that question in practice. I always like to say *"He who controls the juice, controls the feel of the game,"* and one of the more fundamental aspects of game juice is rendering. I want to use this site to document my learning in the art and science of rendering - studying how shaders, materials, and lighting models can transform computation into atmosphere. Each post documents a small experiment: implementing a shader, recreating a visual effect, or reflecting on what makes a scene feel alive.

I'll be updating this space semi-regularly as I learn more. Right now, I have zero experience in shaders and rendering, but I hope as time goes on the topics I upload here get more interesting as I experiment with new techniques and refine my understanding.
