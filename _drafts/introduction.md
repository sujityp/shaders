I've always loved how games made me feel. As a medium, games have the unrivalled ability to *render* worlds and bring them to life. I have a distinct memory of my first time playing Infamous: Second Son and being completely lost in the streets of virtual Seattle. After experiencing the first rainfall scene in that game, I felt I got to witness something magical - with the street lights reflecting off of the puddles, or maybe the wet brick walls of some dilapidated buildings. I had never seen the spirit of something mundane be captured in such divine detail. Despite the neon beams, fiery explosions, and super-human abilities, the world felt real.
